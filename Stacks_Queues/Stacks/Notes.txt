- How to identify that we need to use a stack.


Hint 1 - Whenever we are given an array ( most of the cases ), we can use the stack.


Hint 2 - Main thing 

Now say we have written a solution for O(n^2) like

    for(int i=0;i<n;i++){
        for(int j=0;j<n;j++)     // NOTE : HERE the j is NOT dependant on i.
    }

    for(int i=0;i<n;i++){
        for(int j=0;j<i;j++)   // NOTE : HERE the j is dependant on i 
    }

    Now in this case where j is dependant on i, then there is a possibility of using a stack for sure to,
    reduce the Time Complexity.
